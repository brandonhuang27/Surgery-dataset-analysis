# Surgery-dataset-analysis

In this research project, I used various machine learning classifiers to analyze a dataset and predict which outpatient surgeries will go home same day after surgery.
I performed hyperparameter tuning using grid-search cross-validation to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model.
In the end, I analyzed each model's accuracy scores, F1 scores, AUC scores, sensitivity, and specificity, to determine the best performing model and a SHAP plot to illustrate the feature importances.
